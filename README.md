# Phishing Neural Network Using Logarithmic Regression

Based on a neural network:

*Logistic Regression:* Uses Logistic Function, Neural Network, Sigmoid


Need text segmentation to binary processing,

Three Steps:

*Binary Classifier*

*Gemini API integration*

*Launch UI*


Order of Neural Network:

Raw text  ──► preprocessing (clean, tokenize) ──► feature extraction ──► numeric vector x
x ──► logistic regression ──► probability p ──► decision (phishing vs ham)
